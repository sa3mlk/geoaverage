geoaverage
==========
This is a little utility for Geocachers (in Sweden) to enhance the precision of the coordinates when hiding a new cache.
The map API used is from Eniro, see http://api.eniro.se for further details.

Everything is work in progress, some features that I might add is:
* Use GC.com API to show official geocaches nearby the users location.
* GC.com API to search for a specific GC-code.
* Better GUI control.
* Kalman filter (or similar algorithm) to make better waypoint averaging when hiding.

See http://gulle.se/geoaverage/ for a demo.
